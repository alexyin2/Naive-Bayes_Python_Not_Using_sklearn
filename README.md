# Naive-Bayes
1. This is a practice of helping me to learn the background mathematics in Naive-Bayes.
2. The coding part is based on [lazy programmer](https://github.com/lazyprogrammer)

## Introduction of background theory
1. Naive Bayes uses __*Bayesian Theory*__ and assumes that __*each feature is conditionally independent of every other feature*__.
2. We will show the formula below, using the example of detecting if we should spam an e-mail when it contains specific words.

3. The example showned above doestn't mean that we can only use discreate variables. We can also use continuous variables, just remember that the prior probability is turned into a probability distribution, same as what we've learned in Bayesian Theory.
